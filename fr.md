Differences of opinion are normal. However, persistent, repeated or extremely negative comments can quickly become harassment and are not okay.

It is unacceptable to attack a person or community based on skin color, ethnicity, origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion or disability. Any such discrimination will be reported immediately to the [Discord Trust & Savety team](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731).

3. **NSFW, NSFL or other disturbing or pornographic content is absolutely prohibited**
